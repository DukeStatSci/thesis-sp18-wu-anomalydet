# thesis-sp18-wu-anomalydet
Undergraduate honors thesis of James Wu, to be submitted in Spring 2018

The goal of this project is to identify novel methods for detecting anomalous data in network IP data. We apply principal component analysis to better understand relationships in the data and implement matrix completion via alternating least squares and gibbs sampling for an AMMI statistical model (more methods to come as they are tested).
