# thesis-sp18-wu-anomalydet
Undergraduate honors thesis of James Wu, to be submitted in Spring 2018

The goal of this project is to identify novel methods for detecting anomalous data in network IP data. We will implement and assess the validity of kernel principal component analysis and imputation with singular value decomposition (more methods will be added as they are assessed). The best methods will be refined to be computationally efficient and extrapolated to anomaly detection in general.
