The goal of this paper is to identify novel methods for detecting anomalies in network IP data. The data is comprised of four continuous features (source bytes, destination bytes, source packets, destination packets) divided by their respective source port and destination port combinations. Thus, the data is represented as a 3-dimensional tensor $T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n \times 4}$, where $m$ is the number of source ports, $n$ is the number of destination ports, and $4$ is the number of numerical features. Each cell in $T$, $t_{ijk}$ stores the mean of the observations of continuous feature $k$ between source port at index $i$ and destination port at index $j$. This paper proposes three techniques for generating means to fill in the missing cells in $T$, thereby completing the tensor, so as to provide reasonable estimates for new observations between every possible port combination. In the context of anomaly detection, new observations between ports that do not align closely with their corresponding estimate in $T$ are considered anomalies. The first technique uses a low-rank singular value decomposition algorithm for completing individual matrix slices of the tensor. The second defines a statistical model for the values in $T$ and uses a Bayesian Gibbs sampling procedure to simulate missing cells in individual matrix slices of $T$. Finally, the third approach extends the first and second approaches to completing the tensor all at once, rather than with completing individual matrices.
