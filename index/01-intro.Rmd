#Introduction

##Anomaly Detection

  Anomaly detection is used to identify unusual patterns or observations that do not conform to expected behavior in a dataset. Anomalies can be broadly categorized into three categories:

  Point anomalies: A single instance of data is anomalous if it's too far off from the rest. For example detecting credit card fraud based on a single spending spree that represents the credit card being stolen and used.

  Contextual anomalies: The abnormality is context specific. This type of anomaly is common in time-series data. For instance, high spending on food and gifts every day during the holiday season is normal, but may be considered unusual otherwise.

  Collective anomalies: A set of data observations that when collectively assessed helps in detecting anomalies. For instance, repeated pings from a certain IP address to a port connection on a hosted network may be classified as a port scanner, which often preludes a network attack. 

##Network Attacks 

  Network security is becoming increasingly relevant as the flow of data, bandwith of transactions, and user dependency on hosted networks increase. As entire networks grow in nodes and complexity, attackers gain easier entry points of access to the network. The most benign of attackers attempt to shutdown networks (e.g. causing a website to shutdown with repeated pings to its server), while more malicious attempts involve hijacking the server to publish the attacker's own content or stealing unsecured data from the server, thus compromising the privacy of the network's users.

  Attackers follow a specific three step strategy when gathering intelligence on a network, the most important component of which is scanning. Network scanning is a procedure for identifying active hosts on a network, the attacker uses it to find information about the specific IP addresses that can be accessed over the Internet, their target's operating systems, system architecture, and the services running on each node/computer in the network. Scanning procedures, such as ping sweeps and port scans, return information about which IP addresses map to live hosts that are active on the Internet and what services they offer. Another scanning method, inverse mapping, returns information about what IP addresses do not map to live hosts; this enables an attacker to make assumptions about viable addresses.

  All three of these scanning methods leave digital signatures in the networks they evaluate because they apply specific pings that are then stored in the network logs. Most scanners use a specific combination of bytes, packets, flags (in TCP protocol), and ports in a sequence of pings to a network. Identifying a scanner's often many IP addresses from the set of pings available in the network's logs is thus an anomaly detection problem. In particular, because the data is unlabeled, meaning it is unclear which observations are actually scanners and which are just standard user behavior, unsupervised approaches are necessary for tackling the problem.
  
  This particular dataset is from Duke University's Office of Information Technology (OIT), and it covers all observations in their network traffic during a five minute period in February 2017.

###Status Quo Solution
  OIT's current solution for detecting scanners relies on specific domain knowledge gathered from diagnostics programs and data analysis completed on previous data. They prevent scanners by blocking IP addresses that fit certain rules they have constructed to run on every network transaction as it occurs. The specific checks in these rules are private for security reasons, but they belong to the nature of evaluating the size of transactions, repeated connections between particular ports, many pings from the same address, and combinations of these particular behaviors.

  While this solution presents a methodical way for banning IP addresses and its method of rule checking is essentially removing what OIT considers outliers for network transactions-any observation that does not fit within the constraints specified by the rules is classified as an outleir and its source IP is blocked-it is inflexible, prone to detecting false negatives, and fails to detect  observations that may be within the parameter constraints of the rules but are anomalous with respect to other parameters or parameter constraints.
  
## Network Dataset

### Features
  The networks dataset contains 13 features, 8 categorical and 5 continuous, and the observations are unlabeled (not specified whether they are considered a scanner). The 13 features are: 

**Continuous:**

- StartTime (Start Time): the time when the observation is logged
- SrcBytes (Source Bytes): the total number of bytes sent in the observation 
- SrcPkts (Source Packets): the number of packets sent in the observation
- DstBytes (Destination Bytes): the total number of bytes received in the observation
- DstPkts (Destination Packets): the number of packets received in the observation
Note, the destination packets and bytes features do not have the same values as their source counterparts because the connections are compressed and decompressed into different forms and byte sizes when sent. For instance, it is possible for the number of destination packets to be larger than source packets. It is also possible for information to be lost during the connection.

**Categorical:**

- Flgs (connection flag): flow state flags seen in transaction between the two addresses
- Proto (network protocol): specifies the rules used for information exchange via network addresses. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses a set of rules to exchange messages with other Internet points at the information packet level, and Internet Protocol (IP) uses a set of rules to send and receive messages at the Internet address level.
- SrcAddr (Source Address): the IP address of the connection's source 
- DstAddr (Destination Address): the IP address of the connection's destination
- Sport (Source Port): the network port number of the connection's source. A port numbers identifies the specific process to which a network message is forwarded when it arrives at a server. 
- Dport (Destination Port): the network port number of the connection's destination 
- Dir (direction): the direction of the connection 
- State (connection state): a categorical assessment of the current phase in the transaction when the timestamp is recorded

Note, the addresses have been anonymized for security reasons.

### Argus

  Argus is the open source network security tool applied to network transactions that collects the data for the features. The Argus wiki and the OIT manual provides key insights into the structure and nature of the data. Specifically, the sessions are clustered together by address, so the pytes and packets values are accumulative over a set duration and each session has its own start time but does not have a tracked end time. There exist 2-4 million connections on average every 5 minutes. Furthermore the protocol in this dataset is always gathered from TCP protocol and the direction will always be to the right (i.e. Source to Destination). This information supports dropping proto, StartTime, and Direction from the dataset for future analysis because they do not present any information regarding whether an observation can be considered an anomaly. Furthermore, the State feature may not be reliable because Argus occasionally resets the state data statistics during monitoring.
