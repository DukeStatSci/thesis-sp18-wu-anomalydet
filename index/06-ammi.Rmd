# Statistical Model for Port Behavior

## Motivation

The previous section's results reflected the need for an imputation strategy that accounted for the variability in the number of observations observed for each port combination when imputing that particular combination's cell. The following section constructs a statistical model that takes frequency of observations for each cell into account and repeatedly samples from that statistical model to complete the matrix.
